    <p style= "color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hey there! I'm Marelda Simoes. I'm originally from India, but I'm currently living in Dubai where I'm studying software engineering. I have a bunch of hobbies like origami, playing sports, clay modeling, bracelet making, and sometimes sewing, although I don't think I'm that great at it. I also love watching psychological thriller movies; they really fascinate me.</p>
